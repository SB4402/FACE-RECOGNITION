# FACE-RECOGNITION
FACE RECOGNITION PROJECT

I have developed a project - Face Recognition using image processing


I used the following to make this project - 

1) Python (V3)
2) OpenCV 
3) Web Cam

This project has 3 parts -

1) Data set collection
2) Training data set
2) Detection or test
 
Description: The goal of this project is to detect and locate human faces in a color image.A set of seven training images were provided
for this purpose. The objective was to design and implement a face detector in MATLAB that will detect human faces in an image similar 
to the training images.
The face is one of the easiest ways to distinguish the individual identity of each other.Face recognition is a personal identification 
system that uses personal characteristics of a person to identify the person's identity. Human face recognition procedure basically 
consists of two phases, namely face detection, where this process takes place very rapidly in humans, except under conditions where 
the object is located at a short distance away, the next is the introduction, which recognize a face as individuals. Stage is then 
replicated and developed as a model for facial image recognition (face recognition) is one of the much-studied biometrics technology 
and developed by experts.
Face recognition is the task of identifying an already detected object as a known or unknown face.Often the problem of face recognition 
is confused with the problem of facedetectionFace Recognition on the other hand is to decide if the "face" is someone known, or unknown,
using for this purpose a database of faces in order to validate this input face.
